**Static analysis:** Within the strings of HopHelper.exe, a flag with the format THM{XXXXX} exists. What is that flag value?

Note, this can be found towards the bottom of the strings output.

> `THM{STRINGS_FOUND}`
> 

**Approach:**

```bash
1. PeStudio → File → Open → Desktop/HopHelper/HopHelper.exe
2. File tab → SHA256Sum → [Copy hash value]
3. Strings tab → Scroll bottom → THM{XXXXX} flag
```

**Dynamic analysis:** What registry value has the HopHelper.exe modified for persistence?

Note: Provide the full path of the key that has been modified

> `HKU\S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1008\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\HopHelper`

**Dynamic analysis**: Filter the output of ProcMon for "TCP" operations. What network protocol is HopHelper.exe using to communicate?

Make sure to have executed HopHelper.exe while ProcMon was open and capturing events.

> `http`
> 

**Approach:**

```bash
1. ProcMon → Capture (running)
2. Run HopHelper.exe → Wait 1min → Stop capture
3. Filter → Process Name is HopHelper.exe → OK
4. Filter+ → Operation contains TCP → OK
5. TCP Connect → Protocol: HTTP/HTTPS
